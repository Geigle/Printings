# Cat Toy Arm
Usually my cat chews on strings and snaps them before anything else happens. One time he pulled so hard the arm that attached it to a door broke. So, I designed a replacement arm that wouldn't so easily break.

This design is parametric, so it can be adapted to different doors, boards, or any other place you might put it.
