# Soap Dish

*THIS DESIGN IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT*
---

This is a parametric soap dish design. It has slots and channels set at a deep angle to ensure that water cannot linger with the soap and turn it to mush. The parametric design allows you to size it for specific soap brands, and the optional interlocking arms alllow you to attach multiple dishes together, just in case you need it.

I designed this for my wife when she tried some hair products that came as dry, soap-like pucks.
